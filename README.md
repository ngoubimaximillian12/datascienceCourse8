R Machine Learning Project: Classifying Fitness Tracker Movements
Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques in R to classify the quality of physical movements recorded by wearable fitness devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. These devices enable the collection of detailed accelerometer data during various physical activities, forming the foundation for this analysis.

Using the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset from six participants, the task is to predict how well an exercise (specifically, a barbell lift) was performed. Participants performed the exercise correctly and incorrectly in five different ways. The goal is to use the sensor data to classify the movement type (the "classe" variable in the dataset).

Training Data (CSV)

Testing Data (CSV)

Project Goals
Use sensor data from belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell to train a machine learning model.

Predict the manner in which the exercise was performed ("classe").

Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.

Estimate expected out-of-sample error.

Apply the trained model to 20 test cases and submit predictions for automated grading.

Submission Requirements
GitHub Repository:

Include your R Markdown (.Rmd) and the compiled HTML report.

Keep the report under 2000 words and limit visualizations to 5 figures.

Use a gh-pages branch for easy HTML viewing (recommended).

Prediction File:

Submit your predictions on the 20 provided test cases in the format specified in the programming assignment.

Reproducibility
While peer reviewers will not run your R code due to security concerns, ensure your HTML report is complete and interpretable. Reviewers should be able to fully understand your modeling process by reading the report alone.
